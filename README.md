# at_module_tests
Some simple tests scripts for the at module in Ansible

# Instructions

To execute all the tests cd into the project root and run the following command

./at_module_tests.sh /path/to/at/module.py

i.e.

./at_module_tests.sh

N.B. Paths are hardcoded in the bats file. If you're not me, it won't work, until I update this.
